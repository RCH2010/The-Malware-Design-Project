# The-RansomWare-Project-
The repository containes the required coding files used in the malware design. 

# The Project is under construction 
# Source of motivation 
 Got a source of motivation from the famous Ransomwares that disrupted millions of computers in the world with the evil piece of code 
 
 They are :
 WannaCry 2.0 and Petya Ransomwares . 
 
 
 # The Workflow of the Malware Design : 
 
  1.) AES 256-CBC Symmetric cryptographic Algorithm . 
  2.) Socket Based Command/control server to be controlled by the attacker. 
  3.) Ransomware _ decryption tool to revert back data . 
  4.) Implemented by only secret/private key cryptography for faster execution . 
  5.)  Ransomware_ payload main virus file that is to be run on victim's computer .
