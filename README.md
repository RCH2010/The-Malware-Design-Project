# The-RansomWare-Project-
The repository containes the required coding files used in the malware design. 

# The Project is under construction 
# Source of motivation 
 To Understaand the deep insights of working of Malware specifically Ransomwares on computer systems including their memory traces and possible mitigation and detection        techniques like these famous viruses:  
 WannaCry 2.0 and Petya Ransomwares . 

 # The Workflow of the Malware Design : 
 
  1.) AES 256-CBC Symmetric cryptographic Algorithm for data encryption/decryption purpose . 
  
  2.) Socket Based Multithreaded Command/control server to be controlled by the attacker and handlling unique key generation for multiple Triggers . 
  
  3.) Ransomware _ decryption tool to revert back the encrypted data to the original form  . 
  
  4.) Implemented by only secret/private key cryptography for faster execution . 
  
  5.) Ransomware_ payload main virus file that is to be run on victim's computer . 
  
  6.) Tested on small local LAN network with few Linux and Windows Machines.  
  
  7.) It has a Proper strategy to be followed to decrpt the data after Authetication via numeric Token by the Victim . 
  
  # Warning 
  
  As this is a Kind of Virus program can cause lot of damage if misused , I used to develop this only for understanding of about the how actually Ransomware works and to study about it's post traces on memory, not promoting any illegal activity . 
    
  # The Remote Spyware Project  
  # The Remote Screenshot Sending Malware from Targeted MAC/WINDOWS machine to the attacker through mail service ..
 
  --> This Malware is basically a spying agent as it grabs the screen.
  
  --> Currently it's the basic version only takes screenshot and send to the mail.
  
  --> Its made keeping in mind targeting the single user/victim not multiple victims . 
  
  --> Some another information sending mechanism is to be added despite of only gmail/hotmail etc.
  
  --> Periodic and scheduled screenshot grabbing feature also required
  
  --> Connection and storage into the Registry for achieving the persistence , targeting the Windows specific devices . 
  
  --> Its a .exe exportable with some errors , required to bind it with the image/doc file to make it less suspicious . 
  
  --> The feature of logging the keyboard event is also required.
