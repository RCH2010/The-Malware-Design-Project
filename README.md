# The-RansomWare-Project-
The repository containes the required coding files used in the malware design. 

# The Project is under construction 
# Source of motivation 
 Got a source of motivation from the famous Ransomwares that disrupted millions of computers in the world with the evil piece of code 
 
 They are :
 WannaCry 2.0 and Petya Ransomwares . 
 
 
 # The Workflow of the Malware Design : 
 
  1.) AES 256-CBC Symmetric cryptographic Algorithm . 
  
  2.) Socket Based Command/control server to be controlled by the attacker. 
  
  3.) Ransomware _ decryption tool to revert back data . 
  
  4.) Implemented by only secret/private key cryptography for faster execution . 
  
  5.) Ransomware_ payload main virus file that is to be run on victim's computer . 
  
  6.) Whole of code is combination of these three.--> Programming + operatingsystem + cryptography . 
  
  7.) Not providing the way of running , since it 's currently in development phase as it can cause disruption .
  
  # Warning 
  
  As this is a Kind of Virus program can cause lot of damage if misused , I used to develop this only for understanding of about the how     actually Ransomware works , not promoting any illegal activity and misuse of the program . 
  
  Don't misuse the code :->
  
  # Part 2 ---> The SPYWARE Project  
  # The Remote Screenshot Sending Malware from Targeted MAC/WINDOWS machine to the attacker through mail service ..
 
  --> This Malware is basically a spying agent as it grabs the screen.
  
  --> Currently it's the basic version only takes screenshot and send to the mail.
  
  --> Its made keeping in mind targeting the single user/victim not multiple victims . 
  
  --> Some another information sending mechanism is to be added despite of only gmail/hotmail etc.
  
  --> Periodic and scheduled screenshot grabbing feature also required. 
  
  --> Connection and storage into the Registry for achieving the persistence , targeting the Windows specific devices . 
  
  --> Its a .exe exportable with some errors , required to bind it with the image/doc file to make it less suspicious . 
  
  --> The feature of logging the keyboard event is also required.
